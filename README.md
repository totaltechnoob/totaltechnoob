Hi, I’m Yash

I am into embedded systems programming.
The part I enjoy the most about Embedded systems is that it lets me get close to the hardware and really lift the curtains to see what goes on inside computers.

I am experienced with C, C++ and have dabbled with C# to make games.

Currently I am trying to build and code various components that go into drones, like ESC, PID, so I can make one from scratch without any store-bought components.
